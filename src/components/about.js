            <p>I&apos;m currently working as a Motion Graphic Designer, however am aspiring to get into web/software development.
                Due to my background in design, I figured it would be best to start with front-end web development and exploring
                from there. Once I&apos;ve gotten familiar with React, I&apos;m going to give Python a shot!
